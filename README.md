# Hive Protector

A Reddit app that can be used to ban, report or remove content from users of "undesirable" subreddits from participating in another. Originally inspired by SafestBot.

### Detection Options

**List of Subreddits**: A comma-separated list of subreddits to ban users from e.g. FreeKarma4U, FreeKarmaForAll. Not case sensitive.

**List of Domains**: A comma-separated list of domains to watch for e.g. onlyfans.com, fansly.com. Don't include "www.". Wildcard support is also acceptable e.g. *.substack.com.

**Content type to act on**: You can choose whether to check user content when they submit posts, comments or both. You can also check a user's social links.

**Thresholds**: You can specify a combined posts and comments threshold, a posts threshold and comments threshold separately. Zero means that the threshold will not be checked. At least one threshold should have a value or the Social Links option should be on for the app to have any effect.

**Number of days to monitor**: The app will only check a user's history back this many days. This can be used so that a user's old history is not held against them, or to ban only prolific users of "bad" subreddits.

You can also choose to exempt Approved Users, specific users based on username and users based on specific flairs

### Ban options

Banning users is optional, you can choose to remove, report, reply or send modmail instead.

The application supports three main modes of handling users who have previously been banned by the app.

If you set this to "Never" (the default), the user will never be banned a second time. "Always re-ban" is self-explanatory, and "Ban if new content since previous ban" will only take into account posts or comments in the "bad" subreddits made after their bot ban.

### Other actions

You can choose to make a report on the user, remove their post/comment, reply to the user or notify sub moderators silently via Modmail.

## Operation notes

The app will only check a user once every six hours to avoid flooding the API with requests, it caches the results of the previous check. If a user is over the action threshold the cache duration is reduced to one hour.

However, if a user is unbanned, previously cached results are cleared because an unban may be as a result of a user cleaning up their profile, so it may need to be checked again.

The app will never ban a user based on content in the subreddit the app is installed in - you cannot use this as a "ban anyone who posts or comments" bot.

## Example use cases

* Banning users who have participated in free karma subreddits
* Banning or reporting users from R4R subreddits who have posted in Onlyfans promo subs, or have posted Onlyfans/Fansly links anywhere on Reddit, or have an Onlyfans "social link" on their bio
* Adding a sticky comment on a post in NSFW subreddits warning users about the user's post history in OF promotion subs/sharing OF links elsewhere

## Data stored by the app

This app uses the Community Apps platform's Redis plugin to store very basic information about users checked.

* The date and time that the app last checked a user, to support checking only once every two hours
* User names of users who have been previously banned by the app, along with the date/time of their ban, to prevent inadvertent re-banning.

All data is automatically removed if the app is uninstalled. If a user deletes their account, any data relating to them will be removed within 28 days.
